Final Questions:

1. How did you handle inline editing in the table?

Handling Inline Editing in the Table: I have used the ReactTabulator component and its cellEdited event to handle inline editing. When a cell is edited, the cellEdited callback function is triggered. This function retrieves the updated task data and updates the tasks state accordingly.

<ReactTabulator
  data={filteredTasks}
  columns={taskColumns(setTasks)}
  layout="fitData"
  options={{
    cellEdited: (cell) => {
      const updatedTask = cell.getRow().getData();
      setTasks((prevTasks) =>
        prevTasks.map((task) =>
          task.id === updatedTask.id ? updatedTask : task
        )
      );
    },
  }}
/>


2. Explain how you fetched and processed the data from the dummy API.

Fetching and Processing Data from the Dummy API: I have utilized the useFetchTask custom hook to fetch data from a dummy API("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"). The hook manages the state for tasks and handles the data fetching process using useEffect.
const useFetchTask = () => {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');
        const data = await response.json();
        setTasks(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);
  
  return { tasks, setTasks };
};

3. What approach did you use to filter tasks based on status?

Filtering Tasks Based on Status:I have implemented a filter by status using a state variable statusFilter. The filteredTasks array is derived from the original tasks array by filtering it based on the selected status.

const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState("");

const filteredTasks = statusFilter
  ? tasks.filter((task) => task.status === statusFilter)
  : tasks;


4. How did you manage the state of tasks when adding or editing them?

Managing State of Tasks When Adding or Editing: I have managed the state using useState and updated it through callback functions passed to various components. For adding a task, you updated the tasks array to include the new task. For editing, as seen in the inline editing logic, you mapped through the tasks array and updated the specific task.

// Adding a task
const handleAddTask = (newTask) => {
  setTasks((prevTasks) => [...prevTasks, newTask]);
};


5. What challenges did you face during development, and how did you overcome them

Handling inline editing for dynamically fetched data was tricky initially. I resolved it by carefully configuring ReactTabulator's editor properties and events.
Filtering tasks dynamically while keeping the original data intact required managing state efficiently, which I addressed using React's state management effectively.
